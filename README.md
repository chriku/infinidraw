# InfiniDRAW

An extremly simple drawing program with (nearly) infinite height.
The height of the image changes automatically, while the width is set to 1366px and is zoomed accordingly

Depends:
* lua jit/5.1/5.3 (lua 5.2 could work too, but not tested)
* lua-lgi
* g-object-introspection for gtk, cairo, glib
